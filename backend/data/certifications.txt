I have completed the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate and the Google Project Management Professional Certificate. I also earned a Business Analytics certificate from the University of Colorado Boulder and studied Strategy and Game Theory at IIM Ahmedabad. These certifications helped me balance both technical and managerial skills.
