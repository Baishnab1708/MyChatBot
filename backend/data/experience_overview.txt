I recently finished the Amazon ML Summer School, where I explored everything from the basics of machine learning to advanced stuff like Transformers and large language models. After that, I did a three-month internship at Infosys as a Data Analyst. There, I worked on designing interactive dashboards and also performed ETL tasks to handle and process large datasets. If youâ€™d like, I can tell you more about my internships.
