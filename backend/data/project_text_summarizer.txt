Another important project I built is a Text Summarizer. I fine-tuned a DistilBART variant on XSum and CNN datasets to generate abstractive summaries. I wrapped the model in a Flask API, Dockerized it, and deployed it on Hugging Face. I also built a Vite + Tailwind frontend that lets users upload documents and get concise summaries with control over summary length and context awareness. This project gave me experience in working with large datasets and production deployments of NLP models.
