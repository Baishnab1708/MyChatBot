Hi — I’m Baishnab Charan Behera. I specialize in AI, machine learning, and backend systems. I enjoy building full solutions — from working with data, to training and fine-tuning models, to deploying APIs and creating responsive frontends. I focus on building things that are reliable, secure, and easy to use. When I talk about my work, I like to keep it simple and highlight the impact I made.
