One of my major projects is MediScan, an AI-powered OCR-to-NLP pipeline that extracts and validates medicine details from prescriptions. I used the Azure Read API for OCR and fine-tuned a Llama 3-8B model for entity extraction, reaching about 96% accuracy. On the backend, I built a FastAPI service with JWT authentication, Pydantic validation, and optimized PostgreSQL queries, then deployed it on Render with CI/CD for smooth scalability. For the frontend, I created a responsive React and Tailwind app on Vercel, supporting file uploads and live feedback. The system improved load times by 20% and attracted over 200 users. This project really strengthened my skills in integrating AI models with secure backends and polished frontends.
