I worked as a Data Analyst Intern at Infosys from October to December 2024. My role involved designing interactive Power BI dashboards and implementing ETL workflows to handle millions of data records. I extracted actionable business insights and presented them to stakeholders. This experience improved my skills in data modeling, dashboard design, and communicating results to non-technical audiences.
